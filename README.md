# landing-page

## Goal:
This project serves the purpose of testing and internalize everything I have learned so far through The Odin Project. So far that means a fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS alone, with no regard to scalibility yet.

## After task completion:
While creating this landing page I feel like I got a better understanding of how to go about creating a webpage in a structured manner, as well as, expiriencing first hand how it feels to try and remember everything I learned and get an idea of how much I need to search the web for answers.
